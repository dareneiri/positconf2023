I hope you found this information helpful, at least to get you started on your logging journey. In the future, I'd like to add greater detail to make this more useful. I am aware I glossed over a few details :)

Here are a few additional things to consider when it comes to logging, that I found useful:

-   [The problem with logging](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-logging/)
    -   There's a balance to how much you should log
-   [The Importance of Logging](https://www.thecodedmessage.com/posts/logging/)
    -   Another programmer's perspective on logging
-   [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/conditions.html)
    -   As you include more logging into your code, hopefully you also include conditions (`tryCatch()`), to make your code more robust.
-   [Known issues with RMarkdown and logger package using globalCallingHandlers](https://github.com/daroczig/logger/issues/70)
    -   See [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73135786/issues-when-using-logger-package-in-r-markdown-when-initializing-log-errors) as well
