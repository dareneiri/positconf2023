title: "Options for Logging in R"
---

I wrote this document to provide in-depth information for a five-minute lighting talk I gave at the Posit::Conf(2023) conference in Chicago, IL (September 19, 2023).

With only five minutes to talk about logging, there is so much more information I wanted to share that I just could not get to. I hope others find this information helpful. This is knowledge I have gained through trial and error, and finding a solution that worked well for me. Maybe this information does not apply to you. And if you find the information not helpful or incorrect, then please let me know!

# Section Overview

I have split up my content into separate sections for easier reading. 

1.  **Introduction to Logging:** I discuss what logging is, why it can be useful, and some examples that demonstrate its purpose
2.  **Logging Packages**: I review a few logging packages I have found helpful. It is not meant to review all types of logging packages available.
3.  **Logging Levels**: I dive into different logging levels, such as INFO, WARN, and ERROR, and how to strategically use them. I also discuss why you should not log everything, and how you need to be strategic in what you log.
4.  **Making Logs Accessible**: I discuss how you can review your logs, including through cloud-based solutions. I focus on Azure.
5.  **Configure Sending Syslogs to Azure Monitor**: This extends on the previous topic, along with instructions on setting up a Linux VM for pushing syslogs to Azure Monitor
6.  **Using API to Send Syslogs to Azure Monitor**: This is an alternative approach to writing logs to syslog. If you're using Docker to run your R code, then this may be a better solution.
7.  **Additional Resources**
